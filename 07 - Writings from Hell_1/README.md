## The flag

`[CSC2024Hellschreiber]`

## Initial Attempts

Initially, I tried manipulating the audio by speeding it up and slowing it down, hoping to reveal any hidden information. However, these attempts didn't yield any useful results.

I also noticed some inconsistencies in the audio file:
- In the middle and towards the end, the volume dropped significantly, almost to zero. Despite this, it didn't provide any clear hints or clues.

## Seeking Assistance

To proceed further, I consulted with Groq for suggestions on how to decode or extract potential hidden content from the audio file. Groq recommended exploring spectrograms as a potential method for analysis.

## Learning about Spectrograms

To understand spectrograms better, I watched a helpful video tutorial on YouTube:
- [Understanding Spectrograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvZ7kr9xqeE&t=21s)

The video explained how spectrograms visualize frequencies over time and how they can reveal hidden patterns in audio files.

## Analyzing the Audio File

Armed with this new knowledge, I loaded the WAV file into Audacity to generate and examine its spectrogram.

## Discovering the Flag

Upon analyzing the spectrogram of the audio file in Audacity, there it was. I found the flag!
